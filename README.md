Overview
-This project aims to analyze Airbnb rental listings to uncover key factors influencing rental prices. Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, the workflow covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling. The repository is designed for data science practitioners interested in understanding price dynamics in the short-term rental market.

Features
-Data Cleaning: Remove missing values and duplicates to ensure data quality.

-Feature Engineering: Create new variables (e.g., price per night) for deeper analysis.

-Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize price distributions, neighborhood trends, and seasonal effects.

-Predictive Modeling: Apply regression techniques to predict rental prices based on property features.

-Interactive Notebooks: Combine code, visualizations, and explanations for reproducibility.
